# dataShExchange
This application allows user to define mappings from a relational database to RDF using ShEx as an schema that constraints the number of edges of each node.

The ShERML platform consist of:
1. The graphical mapping language, a declarative mapping language for describing the transformation for a RDB to an RDF constrained by ShEx
2. ShERML Server, an HTTP server that provides an RDF, which is the result of applying graphical mapping language
